# Gizmagick

A browser-based dynamic music player for tabletop sessions. Tracks can loop, transition between sections, switch musical modes, and synchronize playback across a room.

Live app: [wizamp.app](https://wizamp.app).

Gizmagick's logo assets are in `frontend/public/branding`: the full-color PNG is the main app logo, and the black and white SVG variants have transparent backgrounds for compact monochrome uses such as notification icons. The live domain and Cloudflare Worker name retain their existing names. Browser storage keys also retain the `wizamp` prefix so existing preferences are preserved.

## Local development

Use Node.js 22.12+ and npm. From `frontend`:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite. Choose **Private Session (offline)** for local playback. Playback requires a browser audio-unlock gesture; use Play or Enable audio.

For local online testing, start the actual Worker backend in another terminal from `frontend`:

```sh
npm run dev:worker
```

Set these values in `frontend/.env.local`, then restart Vite:

```dotenv
VITE_ONLINE_MODE=true
VITE_WS_URL=/ws
```

Vite proxies `/ws` to the local Worker on port 8787. The browser uses `ws://` on localhost and `wss://` when the app is opened through HTTPS, including an ngrok tunnel. To test on a phone or away from home, run Vite, the local Worker, and `ngrok http 5173`, then open the ngrok HTTPS URL. The Vite `allowedHosts` list must include your ngrok hostname; update `frontend/vite.config.js` if that hostname changes. If Vite selects another port, pass that port to ngrok instead. Restart Vite after changing `.env.local`.

Open two browser tabs with the same `?room=test-room` URL. Choose Director in one and Member or Observer-Member in the other, unlock audio in both, and select a track. Online Play waits for room readiness. For an already deployed backend, use its `wss://.../ws` address instead. Production builds should continue to set `VITE_WS_URL` to the deployed Worker URL; the `/ws` proxy exists only in the Vite development server.

The `server` folder contains the original presence-only Express prototype. It is retained for reference, but it does not implement playback commands and is not the development backend for the current frontend. Use `dev:worker` instead.

## Checks

Run from `frontend`:

```sh
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Tests cover room command dispatch and isolation, playback transition/RNG consistency, timer cancellation, buffer-cache cleanup, and catalog sorting. Browser smoke tests are still needed for real audio-device behavior and multi-device timing.

## Code layout

- `frontend/src/App.jsx`: playback UI, track loading, autoplay, and network synchronization coordination.
- `frontend/src/audio/audioEngine.js`: decoded audio buffers, audio nodes, playback and transitions.
- `frontend/src/audio/transitions.js`: shared deterministic next-clip selection.
- `frontend/src/net/useRoom.js`: WebSocket connection, room commands, readiness and clock estimation.
- `frontend/src/net/useSession.js`: room, role, display name, URL and persisted identity.
- `frontend/src/data`: catalog loading and shared track ordering.
- `frontend/src/components`: controls, settings, and the music database.
- `worker/src/index.js`: Cloudflare Worker and room hub.

## Music data

`frontend/public/trackData.json` contains a `tracks` object keyed by track name. Each entry names its `basePath`, `firstSection`, `simple` flag, and optional display name/test flag.

Each track folder contains:

- `clipData.json`: a `clips` object. Each clip specifies its audio `file` (a string or a map of mode names to files), `loopStart`, `loopPoint`, `clipEnd` in seconds, and `nextClip` choices.
- `sectionData.json`: a `sections` object defining `firstClip`, available `nextSection` choices, optional `modes`, and section type (`auto` or `end` where applicable).
- `audio/`: audio files referenced by the clip metadata. The base mode is named `base`.

The scripts in `frontend/scripts` support audio import and older metadata migration. `process-clips.mjs` requires FFmpeg/FFprobe and may write metadata or convert audio; review its header before running it. Existing `.bak` metadata files are retained as migration backups. Audio and musical metadata are not modified by code cleanup.

Pins, display-name overrides, volumes, and UI preferences are local to the browser. Identity uses `wizamp.role` and `wizamp.displayName`; the former underscore-separated keys are read as migration fallbacks.
